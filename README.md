Marked as one of south-east Asia's fastest-growing nations, Vietnam is blessed with an abundance of natural resources which it invests heavily towards nation-building. Urban centers such as Hanoi or Ho Chi Min City have been subject to rapid expansion and the diversity of the nations rooting in agriculture, aquaculture and rich ecosystems have called for the use of geospatial technology. This diversity in topographical data, demographic and even climate-changing patterns has led to the immense development of GIS technology from industry and academia alike. While the government's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is propelling further GIS use in topography, the struggle for greater transparency in data availability has created grey markets that provide restricted area maps and other maps of higher detail at greater rates.  Potential Vietnam holds for GIS technology is immense and can even be used to address some of the nation's forthcoming problems such as climate change.  Recently, MoNRE and other collaborators have been at the forefront of addressing such things as coastal storm surges and rising sea levels. Regarding agriculture, the role of GIS applications is essential to understanding and predicting the future wellbeing of the country; with the main export, rice, being correlated to its wellbeing, improved models of crop yields, climate change and better data is core to pre-anticipating many economic decisions. In urban planning, the demand for transportation infrastructure, industrial growth, and inroads have driven the use of GIS among organizations such as the Vietnam Institute of Architecture, and Urban Development Agency. Although the plausible applications of GIS technology in Vietnam are encouraging, there remain many problems associated with such opportunities, one being the minimal expertise on the technology in Vietnam. Perhaps the cooperation among both national and international organizations can continue to propel domestic GIS use. This article touches on the various methods to ultimately enrich the legitimate freedoms of all people; ample time and resources can be saved and many organizations can continue to be propelled through the sourcing of GIS. By simply ensuring greater transparency among different sectors, preemptive measures and further policies can be taken to combat such things as economic policies and disaster relief allowing for an all-around improvement in living quality and efficiency, covered by the SDGâ€™s proposed by the UN. Greater investments in GIS technology is imperative to driving such actions, however. This source serves gives insight on some of the overarching issues residing within Vietnam, calling for improvements in specific sectors including, but not limited to, environmental management, climate change, and biodiversity mapping which are all issues surrounding necessary to combating environmental degradation.
