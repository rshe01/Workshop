### 1. Barder also recommended to promote innovation, embrace creative destruction and shape development. What did he mean by these recommendations?

Barder’s overarching point is that development is the emergence of complex adaptive systems and as such the co-evolution between social and economic systems is imperative in promoting innovation. There are many steps which can be taken to continue promoting this adaptive process; we could tackle corruption, protect entrepreneurs and create a safety net for risk takers to ultimately encourage the process of innovation. Barder continues to go on stating that there is no use of having innovation if we don’t have selection. Creative destruction is essentially the process of newer firms adapting to the current market and social demands. With such kinds of feedback loops, it's possible for those 2nd and 3rd world countries to “force performance in economic and social institutions.  The combination of effective mechanics for innovation and selection need to be incorporated into society in a way that fits our communal goals and visions as well. Development policies should not focus on “looking for the missing ingredients” as people have done for the past several decades; it should be about embracing experiment and to nurture adoption and evolution.

### 2. What was the Robert Solow model? How did it address limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful at predicting economic growth? 


Economists relied on the previous Harrod-Domar growth model, a model that implemented linear equations of input and output, to address why certain countries were poorer or wealthier than others. This model, in reality, could not model what was truly replicated in reality as capital and labor data from South Korea could not explain why its growth was so immense compared to countries such as Ghana. Thus Robert Solow revised the model by introducing a third component to the equation: technical change. Now the disparity between rich and poor countries fell upon this idea of technical change, however, while this the new Solow model could explain the data better than the Harrod-Domar model, the notion of technical change was both ambiguous and questionable to many. Shouldn't technology be easy to spread? Such things as knowledge are easy to manufacture. Furthermore, the characteristics of this third component are unexplained; its not valid to treat it as a magical and mysterious character or “manna from heaven.” We have to recognize that adaptation and evolution cannot be captured through the lens of linear equations. The complex nature of various social and economic systems breeds greater complexity, which becomes harder to evaluate linearly.
